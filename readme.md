# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based heart disease prediction model developed to help identify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on several medical features. The aim is to support early detection and improve decision-making in healthcare settings.

## 💡 Features

- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data.
- Built using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Easy-to-use and interpretable model.
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Model Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Splitting into training and testing sets
4. Training using Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM (select as per your model)
5. Evaluating performance

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neha7011/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
